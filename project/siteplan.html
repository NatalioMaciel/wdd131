        <h2>Scenarios:</h2>

        <h3>Are all your items truly handmade?</h3>
        <p>Yes, every item we offer is handcrafted with care and attention to detail.
            From keychains to stuffed animals and board games, each piece is unique,
            made with quality materials and creativity.</p>
        <h3>Can I request a custom design?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! We love working with customers to create custom pieces. Whether
            it's a specific color, design, or even a personalized item, we'll collaborate
            with you to bring your vision to life</p>
        <h3>How long does it take to receive an order?</h3>
        <p>Since our items are handmade, production times vary depending on the complexity
            of the order. Typically, we aim to ship within 5 days, but we'll keep
            you informed throughout the process to ensure timely delivery.</p>
